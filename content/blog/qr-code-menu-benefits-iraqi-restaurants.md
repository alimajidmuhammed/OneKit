# QR Code Menu Benefits for Iraqi Restaurants

The restaurant industry in Iraq is rapidly evolving. With increasing smartphone adoption and changing customer preferences, QR code menus have become essential for modern restaurants.

## Why QR Code Menus Are Perfect for Iraqi Restaurants

### 1. Cost Savings

Traditional printed menus cost 5,000-15,000 IQD per menu to design and print. For a restaurant with 20 tables, that's 100,000-300,000 IQD just for initial printing.

**QR Code Menu Advantages**:
- **One-time cost**: 10,000 IQD/year with OneKit
- **No reprinting** when prices change
- **Instant updates** - Change prices in real-time
- **ROI**: Save 90,000-290,000 IQD in the first year alone!

### 2. Hygiene & Safety

Post-COVID, customers prefer contactless solutions:
- **No physical contact** with shared menus
- **Individual viewing** on personal devices
- **Reduced contamination risk**
- **Modern, clean image**

### 3. Easy Menu Updates

Change your menu instantly:
- **Daily specials** - Update every morning
- **Seasonal items** - Add/remove with one click
- **Price adjustments** - No reprinting required
- **Sold-out items** - Mark unavailable immediately

### 4. Multilingual Support

Iraq's diverse customer base benefits from multiple languages:
- **Arabic** - Standard menu language
- **Kurdish** - For Kurdistan region customers
- **English** - For tourists and expats

OneKit's Menu Maker supports all three languages with proper RTL formatting for Arabic and Kurdish.
